          <h2>Hello.</h2>

          <div class="skill-row">
            <h3>Design & Development</h3>
            <p>I started learning to code from Year 9 and always had a burning curiosity in tech and coding. I've always wanted to learn how to create my own websites, apps and games. Over time, as my interests in tech and computing grew, I gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in Business I.T and Computing through my GCSEs, BTEC and Degree as well as through self-study via online courses in order to aid in achieving my dream goal.</p>

            <h3>MMA & Gym</h3>
            <p>I currently train in Muay Thai, Wrestling and BJJ at Fearless MMA. I love MMA and it has helped me take back control of my emotional and physical wellbeing. It has helped me greatly with self-confidence and also has helped me balance my personality. I am a yellow-belt however I would have been a green belt, if COVID-19 had not prevented my belt assessment!!! I also love going to the gym and have built my body to achieve big PR records. -> Current Weightlifting PRs: Squat: 140KG, Bench: 80KG, Deadlift: 140KG. </p>
